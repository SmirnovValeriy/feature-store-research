# Tests of Dash

In this folder we are testing Dash framework to see whether the framework is proper for our goals or not.

***
**Test1.** 

We created a simple dashboard and displayed 90 features distributions. \
You can see screenshots of resulting dashboard in **result1.png** and **result2.png**. 

To try this app you need to have the latest version of Dash and some Java Script interpretator. \
Run the app using: \
**```$ python3 dash_try.py```**
