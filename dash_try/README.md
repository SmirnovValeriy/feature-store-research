# Tests of Dash

In this folder we are testing Dash framework to see whether the framework is proper for our goals or not.

***
**Test1.** 

In **[Test 1](https://github.com/SmirnovValeriy/feature-store-research/tree/master/dash_try/Test%201)** we created a simple dashboard and displayed 90 features distributions. \
You can see screenshots of resulting dashboard in **[result1.png](https://github.com/SmirnovValeriy/feature-store-research/tree/master/dash_try/Test%201/result1.png)** and **[result2.png](https://github.com/SmirnovValeriy/feature-store-research/tree/master/dash_try/Test%201/result2.png)**. 

To try this app you need to have the latest version of Dash and some Java Script interpretator. \
Run the app using: \
**```$ python3 dash_try.py```**
***

**Test2.** 

In **[Test 2](https://github.com/SmirnovValeriy/feature-store-research/tree/master/dash_try/Test%202)** we tried to simulate main pipeline of features quality analytics: upload a large dataframe,
display the dataframe and show 60 features distribution.
You can see screenshots of resulting dashboard in **[result1.png](https://github.com/SmirnovValeriy/feature-store-research/tree/master/dash_try/Test%202/result1.png)**, **[result2.png](https://github.com/SmirnovValeriy/feature-store-research/tree/master/dash_try/Test%202/result2.png)** and **[result3.png](https://github.com/SmirnovValeriy/feature-store-research/tree/master/dash_try/Test%202/result3.png)**

To try this app you need to have the latest version of Dash and some Java Script interpretator. \
Run the app using: \
**```$ python3 dash2_try.py```**
